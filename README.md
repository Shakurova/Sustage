# Sustage
## Junction Hackathon 2018, Helsinki 
### HEALTH, SUSTAINABILITY AND CONVENIENCE THROUGH DATA challenge


Users love discounts and fun challenges, don't they? And K Group would like to have more loyal customers and working towards the image of the most sustainable retail chain in the world.

Is there a win-win solution?

By using gamification and involving the customer to play the game, we want to encourage sustainable behaviour.

We all know that using plastic bags contaminates the environment, sugar is bad for your health and using recyclable products is a step towards living a more sustainable life. But nevertheless, this is not a good enough motivation to make most users take action.

The idea is simple! We set the rules of the game which are always transparent to the customer: you try to unlock achievements by making sustainable and healthy decisions and K-Market gives you the discount that you deserved. You are healthy, feel satisfied and the planet is saved.

Simple rules, instant rewards, effortless integration into the K Group eco-system. Do you want to bring up sustainable behaviour, develop good habits and educate yourself about what is good and what is bad in a fun and effortless way?
